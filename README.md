What is Mind Music coin?
Mind Music harnesses the power of music to capture the imagination of the world. Millions of people suffer everyday with poor mental health. Mind Music intends to collaborate with major worldwide artists to raise awareness on a global scale. Through our album releases, we will #breakthestigma, and bring people together for an incredibly important, long overdue conversation. Join us and be part of a musical revolution!

How Can I Benefit?
As a Mind Music Coin investor, you will benefit in several different ways. Aside from the obvious benefits that you will contribute to Mental Health Awareness, your investment will benefit from;

Automatic Buybacks
We charge a 2% buyback tax on every transaction. This tax is stored into a separate trackable wallet. Every time the buyback wallet hits a balance of 10 BNB, the 10 BNB is then used to buy and burn Mind Music coin to increase its value for holders. You can track the buy back wallet here.

Sales Profits
While 80% of the profits generated from record sales will be donated to mental health and suicide prevention charities, 20% of the profits from any record sales will be used to buy and burn Mind Music Coin and even further increase its value for holders. As the Mind Music record label grows, so will your investment.

Reflection
1% of every transaction is redistributed to holders depending on the percentage of tokens you hold. This means the amount of Mind Music Coin you hold will constantly increase.

Burn
1% of every transaction is removed from circulation. The constant reduction in the coins supply will increase the coins value in relation to the total liquidity over time.
